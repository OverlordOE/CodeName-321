			[Jumping]
		pressing or holding the Spacebar key will move the character upwards but only if they were touching the ground while pressing space, jumping will allow the player to move anywhere between 2 to 4
		tiles vertically depending on the length of the press. The jump has to be immediate and responsive.

	Attacks
		[Automatic Combo's]
		any combo can flow over into any other combo, the second combo will then start where the 1st one left off. for example, the player uses combo 1 twice and then switches to combo 2, the player would use
		the third attack in the sequence because that is where combo 1 left off. transitioning a combo can be done seemlessly.

			[Combo 1]
		{key?}, will perform a basic combo of attacks that continue by repeatedly pressing the button to begin the combo but only if the previous attack hit the opponent, and if the last hit connects to an
		opponent will briefly slow time until any other attack is performed or 0.5 seconds has passed. The combo will go as follows:
			- 1st hit -> Character performs a jab which will have plants extending out of his arms for 2 tiles, able to hit max. 3 enemies at once.
			- 2nd hit -> Character performs a kick with a range of 3 tiles which knocks the opponent prone for 0.3 seconds, able to hit max. 3 enemies at once.

			- 4th hit -> Character conjures a giant hammer with a range of 6 tiles and charges it for as long as the activation key is held, the longer the charge the more damage it deals(dmg = 1.2x + B(where x is the amount of
			time the button is held and B is the base damage))

			[Combo 2]
